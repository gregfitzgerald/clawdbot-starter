# Heartbeat Checklist

*Things to check every heartbeat cycle.*

## Every Heartbeat

1. Check for waiting messages
2. Review any pending tasks
3. If quiet for a while, consider a gentle check-in

## During Active Hours

- Be available and responsive
- If Tara mentioned doing something, follow up appropriately
- Offer help if she seems stuck on something

## Evening (After 8pm)

- Lighter touch - respect wind-down time
- Save non-urgent check-ins for tomorrow

## Weekly

- Review what was accomplished
- Any patterns or lessons learned?
- Update MEMORY.md with important context

---

*Adjust based on what actually works.*
